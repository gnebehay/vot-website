# VOTS2023 Challenge
 
Tracking has matured to a point where the constraints enforced in past VOT challenges can be relaxed and general object tracking should be considered in a broader context. The new Visual Object Tracking and Segmentation challenge VOTS2023 thus no longer distincts between single- and multi-target tracking nor between short- and long-term tracking. We propose a single challenge that requires tracking one or more targets simultaneously by segmentation over long or short sequences, while the targets may disappear during tracking and reappear later in the video.
