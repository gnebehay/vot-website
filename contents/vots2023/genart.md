## VOTS2023 GenArt Challenge
 
Inspired by recent developments of generative art and to promote [VOT X channel](https://twitter.com/votchallenge), we are introducing [VOTS2023 GenArt](https://twitter.com/hashtag/VOTS2023GenerativeArt), an exciting summer challenge for showcasing creativity and artistic flair of the tracking community. The challenge is open to everyone, including researchers, students, and practitioners. 

Use generative art models to create images or video containing the VOTS2023 logo, or variations of it. The context is not restricted to tracking topics. The challenge seeks unconventional, mind-bending creations that defy the norm. The weirder and more innovative, the better!

### Challenge summary and winner announcement
