# VOTS2023 GenArt Challenge

Inspired by recent developments of generative art and to promote [VOT Twitter channel](https://twitter.com/votchallenge), we are introducing an exciting summer challenge aimed at showcasing creativity and artistic flair of the tracking community. The challenge is open to everyone, including researchers, students, and practitioners. We seek unconventional, mind-bending creations that defy the norm. The weirder and more innovative, the better!

Apply generative art to create images containing the VOTS2023 logo, or variations of it. The context is not restricted to tracking topics. The challenge seeks unconventional, mind-bending creations that defy the norm. The weirder and more innovative, the better! 

For inspiration, you can check the [VOT2022 Workshop coffee break montage](https://data.votchallenge.net/vot2022/coffee_break.mp4) made by [Vitjan Zavrtanik](https://vicos.si/people/vitjan_zavrtanik/).

 1. Generate an image using a generative image or video engine/pipeline of your choice.
 1. Follow the [VOT Twitter channel](https://twitter.com/votchallenge).
