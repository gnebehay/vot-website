# VOTS2024 GenArt Challenge
 
Inspired by recent developments of generative art and to promote [VOT X channel](https://twitter.com/votchallenge), we are introducing VOTS-GenArt2024, an exciting challenge for showcasing the creativity and artistic flair of the tracking community. The challenge is open to everyone; you do not have to participate in the main tracking challenge.

Use generative art models to create images or videos, such as those containing the VOTS logo, variations, references to the VOT/VOTS sequence, etc. The context is not restricted to tracking topics. The challenge seeks unconventional, mind-bending creations that defy the norm. The weirder and more innovative, the better! See the [VOTS2023 GenArt page](../vot2023/genart.html) and [previous submissions](https://x.com/hashtag/VOTS2023GenerativeArt) for examples and inspiration.
