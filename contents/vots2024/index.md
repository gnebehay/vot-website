# VOTS2024 Challenge

Visual Object Tracking and Segmentation challenge VOTS2024 is a continuation of the VOTS2023 challenge, which no longer distincts between single- and multi-target tracking nor between short- and long-term tracking. It requires tracking one or more targets simultaneously by segmentation over long or short sequences, while the targets may disappear during tracking and reappear later in the video.
Three challenges:

 * VOTS2024 challenge - Continuation of the VOTS2023 challenge. The task is to track one or more general targets over short-term or long-term sequences by segmentation.
 * VOTSt2024 challenge - A new sub-challenge this year considers general objects undergoing a topological transformation, such as vegetables cut into pieces, machines disassembled, etc.
 * [VOTS-GenArt2024 challenge](genart.html) - Continuation of the VOTS-GenArt2023 challenge aimed at showcasing creativity and artistic flair of the tracking community in the era of generative computer vision. The task is to generate VOTS-related images or short video clips using generative models.
