Visual Object Tracking and Segmentation challenge VOTS2024 is a continuation of the VOTS2023 challenge, which no longer distincts between single- and multi-target tracking nor between short- and long-term tracking. It requires tracking one or more targets simultaneously by segmentation over long or short sequences, while the targets may disappear during tracking and reappear later in the video.

Two challenges are organized:

 * VOTS2024 challenge - Continuation of the VOTS2023 challenge. The task is to track one or more general targets over short-term or long-term sequences by segmentation.
 * VOTSt2024 challenge - A new sub-challenge this year considers general objects undergoing a topological transformation, such as vegetables cut into pieces, machines disassembled, etc.

## Important dates

 * 13th of May, 2024 - All challenges open
 * 23rd of June, 2024 - VOTS2024 & VOTSt2024 results submission deadline
 * 13th of July, 2024 - VOTS2024 & VOTSt2024 winners announcement
 * 29th of September, 2024 - VOTS2024 workshop at ECCV2024
