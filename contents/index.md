</div-->

The VOT challenges provide the visual tracking community with a precisely defined and repeatable way of comparing short-term trackers as well as a common platform for discussing the evaluation and advancements made in the field of visual tracking.

The goal of the challenges is to build up a repository of considerable benchmarks and to organize workshops or similar events in order to push forward research in visual tracking.

  <div class="panel-body">

  VideoNet is a new initiative to bring together the community of researchers that have put effort into creating benchmarks for video tasks.  The goal of the VideoNet is to exchange ideas on how to improve annotations, evaluation measures, and learn from each other's experiences. More information available at the [official page](http://videonet.team/).
