# About the VOT 2013 dataset

The dataset comprises 16 short sequences showing various objects in challenging backgrounds.The sequences were chosen from a large pool of sequences using a methodology based on clustering visual features of object and background so that those 16 sequences sample evenly well the existing pool. The sequences were annotated by the VOT committee using axis-aligned bounding boxes.

The dataset is automatically downloaded by the evaluation kit during the install process; there is no need to separately download the sequences for the challenge. The following gallery gives an overview of the dataset (hover over image to see several snapshots from the sequence, click to view sequence details).
