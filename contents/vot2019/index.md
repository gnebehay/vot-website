The VOT challenges provide the tracking community with a precisely defined and repeatable way of comparing short-term trackers and long-term trackers as well as a common platform for discussing the evaluation and advancements made in the field of visual tracking. Following six highly successful VOT challenges, the 7th Visual Object Tracking Challenge VOT2019 workshop will be held in conjunction with the [ICCV2019](http://iccv2019.thecvf.com/).
