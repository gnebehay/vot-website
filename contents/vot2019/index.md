<h4>VOT-RGBT-annotation update</h4>
Due to the semi-automatic annotation process, some few frames had slightly inaccurate bounding boxes and in some few cases, one coordinate of the bonding box was placed outside the image. In order to avoid technical problems and inaccuracies in the evaluation, we decided to update the annotations. Please delete your local copy of the dataset on the disk and re-run the experiment (the toolkit will download the new dataset automatically). We apologize for potential extra work and hope to welcome you at the VOT-workshop!

The VOT challenges provide the tracking community with a precisely defined and repeatable way of comparing short-term trackers and long-term trackers as well as a common platform for discussing the evaluation and advancements made in the field of visual tracking. Following six highly successful VOT challenges, the 7th Visual Object Tracking Challenge VOT2019 workshop will be held in conjunction with the [ICCV2019](http://iccv2019.thecvf.com/).

## Highlights

* Two new challenges introduced (VOT-RGBT & VOT-RGBD)
* VOT-RGBT2019 challenge will evaluate trackers that use 4 channels (RGB + IR) in tracking.
* VOT-RGBD2019 challenge will evaluate trackers that use 4 channels (RGB + depth) in tracking.
* Updated VOT toolkit to support multi-channel inputs.
* Authors of well-performing trackers will be invited to coauthor the VOT2019 results papers.
* Authors of top-performing trackers will be invited to present their trackers at VOT2019 workshop.

## The VOT2019 Challenges

* VOT short-term tracking challenge VOT-ST2019 (same as in VOT2018) - Robust short-term tracking under appearance variation, occlusion and clutter.
* VOT short-term real-time challenge VOT-RT2019 (same as in VOT2018) - Robust short-term tracking under time constraints.
* VOT long-term tracking challenge VOT-LT2019 (same as in VOT2018) - Robust tracking with target disappearance.
* VOT thermal and infrared short-term tracking challenge VOT-RGBT2019 (NEW) - Multi-modality tracking under RGB and T partial modality de-synchronization.
* VOT color and depth long-term tracking challenge VOT-RGBD2019 (NEW) - Using depth to improve LT RGB tracking with target disappearance.

## Participation

* Run your tracker on one or more challenges and submit the results.
* Submit a tracking paper as a standard submission.
* Authors of high-quality tracking papers not accepted to ICCV due to, e.g., insufficient significance, can re-submit to VOT.
