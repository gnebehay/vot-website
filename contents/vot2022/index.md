# VOT2022 Challenge

The VOT challenges provide the tracking community with a precisely defined and repeatable way of comparing short-term trackers and long-term trackers as well as a common platform for discussing the evaluation and advancements made in the field of visual tracking. 
Following eight highly successful VOT challenges, the 10th Visual Object Tracking Challenge VOT2022 will be held in the spring of 2022.

## Challenges

 * VOT-ST2022 segmentation tracking challenge (short-term, input RGB, target localized by a segmentation mask)
 * VOT-RT2022 segmentation tracking challenge (short-term, realtime, input RGB, target localized by a segmentation mask)
 * VOT-STBB2022 bounding box tracking challenge (short-term, input RGB, target localized by a bounding box)
 * VOT-RGBD2022 tracking challenge (short term, input RGB+depth, target localized by a bonding box)
 * VOT-LT2022 tracking challenge (long term, input RGB, target localized by a bounding box) 
 
## What's new
 * The VOT-ST2022 segmentation tracking challenge dataset refreshed
 * The bounding box tracking challenge re-introduced (VOT-STBB2022). To facilitate development o bounding-box trackers, which remain popular in tracking community, we will run a challenge on the same sequences as VOT-ST2022, but with bounding box ground truth
 * The VOT-RGBD2022 challenge will apply a short-term tracking methodology as VOT-ST2022
 * New long-term tracking dataset introduced in VOT-LT2022
