# Performing evaluation with VOT toolkit

This tutorial assumes that you already have the toolkit on your computer, that you have [set up](workspace.html) the workspace correctly, and that you have a tracker correctly [integrated](integration.html) into the toolkit.

1. Open Matlab or Octave, go to the workspace directory and execute `run_experiments` script.

    If the execution does not start or the toolkit reports an error it is very likely that there is an error with the setup so, please re-check your configuration steps.

2. If you have to interrupt the evaluation at any time you can do it by pressing ´Ctrl+C´. To continue the evaluation simply run `run_experiments` script again, the evaluation will continue from the position of interruption.

3. Once the experiments are complete you can run `run_pack` script that validates the results and generates a valid archive suitable for submission to the VOT challenge.
