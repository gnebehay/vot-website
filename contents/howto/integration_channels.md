# Integrating tracker into the VOT toolkit (multi-channel support)

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you already have the toolkit on your computer:
The [toolkit](https://github.com/votchallenge/vot-toolkit) and [TraX](https://github.com/votchallenge/trax) are downloaded from github repository.
Note that the source code has to be checkouted from <b>channels</b> branch. TraX protocol has to be compiled manually using cmake and C++ compiler.
Be careful that TraX is compiled using the same architecture (32 or 64 bit) as your tracker and Matlab are using. In the `configuration.m` set the following command:

	set_global_variable('trax_source', '<path-to-trax-folder>');

It is important that you compile TraX and set `trax_source` variable before next steps described in this tutorial.
If you will not manually compile TraX from branch <b>channels</b>, the toolkit will automatically download TraX from master branch and compile it, but it will not work.

## Integrating the tracker

After the worspace set up (more information about the process are available [here](workspace.html)) has been successful the following steps are needed:

A template file for your tracker, which was generated by the workspace set up process, has to be manually edited.
Open the tracker configuration file `vot-workspace/tracker_{{name}}.m`, where `{{name}}` is the unique identifier of your tracker:
- Remove line: `error('Tracker not configured!');`
- Optionally, set `tracker_label = [];` to `tracker_label = '{{name}}';`, where `{{name}}` is a non-unique human-readable name of the tracker.
- Set the `tracker_command` variable to the absolute path to your tracker executable and the optional parameters as explained further down.
In case of Python tracker the tracker_command should have (besides path to the directory where the script of the tracker is) also path to the <b>support/python</b> directory which is in trax directory.
- If you are using an interpreter to run your tracker (e.g. Matlab or Python) verify that `tracker_interpreter` variable is set to the correct value.
- Set variable `tracker_linkpath` if the tracker needs some additional libraries which are not in standard library path.
In case of C/C++ or Python tracker the tracker_linkpath variable has to contain path to the TraX <b>lib</b> and <b>bin</b> directories (they are generated at TraX compiling process).

Also, verify that `./vot-workspace/run_experiments.m` line `tracker = tracker_load('{{tracker}}')` is set that `{{tracker}}` is the unique identifier of your tracker. (e.g. `tracker = tracker_load('NCC')`). This is important to do if you are running multiple trackers in the same workspace.

The best way to get familiar with integration of trackers into the VOT toolkit is by looking one of the examples that are provided in the `/tracker/examples` directory of the VOT toolkit. Also, look at the rest of this document for specifics on integration of trackers written in different languages.

We have prepared example `tracker_Demo_{{language}}.m` configuration files for all programming languages which are currently supported by the toolkit.
They can be found in the `tracker/examples` directory. In these files you can see how your `vot-workspace/tracker_{{name}}.m` should look like.


## Native trackers

For native trackers, written in C or C++ the communcation between the toolkit and the tracker is handled by the code in the `vot.h` file that is available in the `tracker/examples/native` directory. Below is a simple example that illustrates how the communication is performed using this header file in C code.

    // Uncomment line below if you want to use rectangles
    // #define VOT_RECTANGLE
    #include "vot.h"

    int main( int argc, char** argv)
    {
        int f;
        vot_region* region = vot_initialize(); // Initialize the communcation
        const vot_image* image = vot_frame();
		const char* imagefile = image->visible;
		const char* depthfile = image->depth;

        // TODO: Load the first frame and use the initialization region to initialize the tracker.

        for(f = 1;; f++)
        {

            const vot_image* image = vot_frame();
			if (!image) break;
			const char* imagefile = image->visible;
			const char* depthfile = image->depth;

            // tracker can report the confidence of the predicted region
            float confidence;  // (optional)

            // TODO: Perform a tracking step with the image, obtain new region

            vot_report2(region, confidence); // Report the position of the tracker
        }

        vot_region_release(&region); // In C regions have to be released to free memory.
        vot_quit(); // Output the results and clear the resources
        return 0;
    }

If the code is compiled as C++ the following simple example illustrates how the communication is performed using the same header file using classes.

    // Uncomment line below if you want to use rectangles
    // #define VOT_RECTANGLE

	#define VOT_RGBD
    #include "vot.h"

    int main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {

        VOT vot; // Initialize the communcation

        VOTRegion region = vot.region(); // Get region and first frame
		VOTImage image = vot.frame();
        string pathRGB = image.visible;
		string pathD = vot.depth;

        // TODO: Load the first frame and use the initialization region to initialize the tracker.

        //track
        while (true) {
            image = vot.frame(); // Get the next frame
			pathRGB = image.visible;
			pathD = image.depth;
            if (pathRGB.empty()) break; // Are we done?

            // tracker can report the confidence of the predicted region
            float confidence;  // (optional)

            // TODO: Perform a tracking step with the image, obtain new region

            vot.report(region, confidence); // Report the position of the tracker
        }

        // Finishing the communication is completed automatically with the destruction
        // of the communication object (if you are using pointers you have to explicitly
        // delete the object).

        return 0;
    }

To register a native tracker in the environment, simply set the `tracker_command` variable value in the tracker configuration file to the full absolute path to the executable (optionally together with required parameters if the tracker requires some).

**TraX library**: The wrapper header overlays the TraX library to communicate with the toolkit. Because of this you have to download and enable the [TraX library](https://github.com/votchallenge/trax) (precompiled releases are available for major platforms on [BinTray](https://bintray.com/votchallenge/trax/stable/_latestVersion)).

**Linking problems**: In some cases the executable requires access to some additional libraries, found in non-standard directories. Matlab overrides the default linking path environmental variable, which can cause linking problems in some cases. For this we have introduced a `tracker_linkpath` variable. This variable should be a cell-array of all directories that should be included in the linking path. An example below adds two custom directories to the library path list in Linux:

    tracker_linkpath = {'/usr/lib64/qt4/', '/usr/lib64/opencv/'};

## Matlab trackers

Matlab-based trackers are a bit more tricky to integrate as the scripts are typically run in an integrated development environment. In order to integrate a Matlab tracker into the evaluation, a wrapper function has to be created.

The communcation between the toolkit and the tracker is handled by the code in `vot.m` file that is available in the `tracker/examples/matlab` directory. It is best to copy this file to your tracker directory. The function `vot` accepts a string parameter that should contain either value `'rectangle'` or `'polygon'` depending on which region format does your tracker expect (formats will be automatically converted, however, you may want to do it manually to avoid any problems and to get the most information from the input data). Below is a simple example that illustrates how the communication is performed.

    function your_tracker

        RandStream.setGlobalStream(RandStream('mt19937ar', 'Seed', sum(clock))); % Set random seed to a different value every time as required by the VOT rules.

        [handle, image, region] = vot('rectangle', 'rgbd'); % Obtain communication object

        image_rgb = imread(image{1}); % Read first (RGB) image from file
		image_depth = imread(image{2}); % Read first (Depth) image from file
        % TODO: Initialize the tracker with first image and the given initialization region

        while true

            [handle, image] = handle.frame(handle); % Get the next frame

            if isempty(image) % Are we done?
                break;
            end;

            image_rgb = imread(image{1}); % Read the image (RGB) from file
			image_depth = imread(image{2}); % Read the image (Depth) from file
	        % TODO: Perform a tracking step with the image, obtain new region

			% Report position and confidence (optionally) for the given frame
            handle = handle.report(handle, region, confidence);

        end;

        handle.quit(handle); % Output the results and clear the resources

    end

For an concrete example of integration please check out the Matlab tracker example in the `tracker/examples/matlab` directory.

When specifying the `tracker_command` variable in the tracker configuration file please note that the wrapper script file is not the one being executed but functions only as a parameter to the Matlab executable. For convinience, the toolkit provides a function that generates a valid `tracker_command` string for Matlab trackers by specifying the script that should be run and the directories that should be included before that.

    tracker_command = generate_matlab_command('<TODO: tracker script>', {'<TODO: path to script>'});

It is important that all the directories containing required Matlab scripts are contained in the MATLAB path when the evaluation is run. Also note that any unhandled exception thrown in the script will result in Matlab breaking to interactive mode and that this will prevent the evaluation from continuing. It is therefore advised that all exceptions are handled explicitly so that the wrapper script always terminates the interpreter.

**TraX mex**: The wrapper header overlays the TraX library to communicate with the toolkit. If you have downloaded the toolkit with pre-compiled MEX files it should already include the required components, otherwise the toolkit will compile them (you need a C/C++ compiler to do that).

## Python trackers

For trackers, written in Python the communcation between the toolkit and the tracker is handled by the code in the `vot.py` file that is available in the `tracker/examples/python` directory. Below is a simple example that illustrates how the communication is performed using this header file in Python code:

    #!/usr/bin/python
    import vot
    import sys
    import time

    handle = vot.VOT("rectangle", "rgbd")
    selection = handle.region()

    # Get paths of color and depth images
    colorimage, depthimage = handle.frame()
    if not imagefile:
        sys.exit(0)

	# TODO: Read both images and initialize tracker

    while True:
        imagefile = handle.frame()
        if not imagefile:
            break

		# Get paths of color and depth images
		colorimage, depthimage = handle.frame()

		# TODO: Read both images and track the object

        handle.report(selection, confidence)
        time.sleep(0.01)

When specifying the `tracker_command` variable in the tracker configuration file please note that the wrapper script file is not the one being executed but functions only as a parameter to the Python interpreter executable. For convinience, the toolkit provides a function that generates a valid `tracker_command` string for Python trackers by locating the interpreter executable and specifying the script that should be run and the directories that should be included before that.

    tracker_command = generate_python_command('<TODO: tracker script>', {'<TODO: path to script>'});

It is important that all the directories containing required modules are contained in the Python path or provided to the generator command.

**TraX package**: The wrapper class for Python overlays the TraX library to communicate with the toolkit. You can get the Python implementation of the TraX protocol in the [reference implementation repository](https://github.com/votchallenge/trax), but by default the toolkit should also download it when it is initialized (check if `native/trax` directory exists).

## Testing integration

It is not recommended to immediately run the entire evaluation without testing the integration on a simpler task. For this the toolkit provides the `run_test` function that provides an interactive environment for testing your tracker on various sequences.

Using this environment you can verify the correct interpretation of input and output data (at the moment the interactive visualization only works in Matlab) as well as estimate the entire evaluation time based on several runs of the tracker on various sequences (run the tracker on several sequences, then select the option to display required estimate).

## Integration rules

To make the tracker evaluation fair we list several rules that you should be aware of:

* _Stochastic processes_ - Many trackers use pseudo-random sampling at certain parts of the algorithm. To properly evaluate such trackers the random seed should not be fixed to a certain value. The best way to ensure this is to initialize seed with a different value every time, for example using current time. In C this is done by calling `srandom(time(NULL))` at the beginning of the program, while one way of doing this in Matlab is by calling:

		RandStream.setGlobalStream(RandStream('mt19937ar', 'Seed', sum(clock)));

* _Image stream_ - The tracking scenario specifies input images as a stream. Therefore the tracker should always only access images in the specified order and not skip ahead.
* _Tracker parameters_ - The tracker is supposed to be executed with the same set of parameters on all the sequences. Any effort to determine the parameter values that were pre-tuned to a specific challenge sequence from the given images is prohibited.
* _Resources access_ - The tracker program should only access the files in the directory that it is executed in.
* _Tracking confidence_ - A tracker can report the confidence of predicted region. The number can be on an arbitrary range where high value represents high confidence and vice versa. In the long-term tracking challenge reporting of a confidence score is required, while it is optional for the main challenge.

While we cannot enforce these guidelines in the current toolkit, the adherence of these rules is mandatory. Any violation is considered as cheating and could result in disqualification from the challenge.
