### Preparation

- **Is it safe to use non-ASCII characters in filesystem paths?**

   Short answer: better not. Long answer: it turns out that UTF support is not fully present in Matlab at the moment so even if the rest of the toolkit would support it, you would have problem. But since we cannot test and debug it, we recommend that you stay away from non-ASCII filesystem paths.

- **I have a workspace that was created using VOT toolkit 1 (VOT2013) or 2 (VOT2014). What do I have to do to use the workspace in VOT toolkit 3 (VOT2015)?**

   For VOT2015 we have made some changes to the toolkit. Most of them are just reorganization and renaming of functions and scripts. To use an old workspace with the new toolkit, you have to either rename these functions in all the scripts with `run_` prefix in your workspace, but the easier option is to delete the `configuration.m` script and run the `workspace_create` script in the folder again. Keep all the subdirectories as they are, they will not get overwritten, but the scripts will get re-generated.

### Running the tracker

- **I am trying to integrate a tracker to the toolkit but I keep getting a *"File not found"* (or something similar) error. What should I do?**

   The toolkit running trackers as external programs in temporary directories for each run. Therefore, the path to the executable should be absolute. Another thing that you have to be careful about are spaces in the command path. If your path contains spaces you will probably have to escape them or add double-quotes around the entire command to tell the operating system that this is one single path element.

- **Do the coordinates of the regions used in the toolkit start with 0 or with 1?**

   The coordinate system in the toolkit starts with (0, 0) in the top-left corner of the image. If you notice that there is different handling of coordinates anywhere in the code, please let us know by submitting a bug report.

- **I am trying to integrate a tracker to the toolkit but I keep getting a *"Timeout"* (or something similar) error. What should I do?**

   If your tracker is slow, the new integration protocol will raise a timeout error if the tracker will not issue a correct feedback in `30` seconds when initialized or presented with a new frame. If your tracker needs more than 30 seconds to process a frame, then you should increase the default timeout interval by adding the following line to your `configuration.m` file:

        set_global_variable('trax_timeout', <add the timeout in seconds here>);

- **When I try to run the experiments the toolkit stops with an exception *Error during tracker execution*. What should I do?**

   The cause of this error is typically that the tracker has crashed, either because of a bug in the code or because of improper configuration. The toolkit tries to capture as much of the output of the tracker to help you debug it. The log files for each occurrence of unexpected error are stored in the `logs` folder in your workspace. The exact folder of a crash is also mentioned in the exception message.

   It is advised that you first try to resolve the problem yourself, however, if you are unable to do it, then you can also ask at the VOT support forum, you may be asked for the content of the crash log folder so do not delete it's content too early.

### Running experiments

- **Why does the toolkit run tracker on each sequence multiple times?**

    Because many trackers are not deterministic (do not produce the same results on every run due to stochastic optimization or similar processes), the toolkit has to evaluate the tracker multiple times on the same data to get a better representation of the average performance and the variation of the performance. If a tracker is deterministic, this is not necessary, however, since the toolkit can only reliably determine this after a couple of runs, the tracker is still run three times to check if the results do not change.

- **How to change number of repetitions per sequence?**

   Alter a variable `parameters.repetitions` field in experiment stack you are using, e.g. for VOT2013 stack, edit file `stacks/stack_vot2013.m` by changing default number 15.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
Be careful when changing the official benchmark parameters. For a valid submission you have to make sure that the settings remain the same to the original version. </br>

Also note that the ranking methodology requires 15 repetitions to work reliably because the statistical tests will not work on small number of samples. The toolkit will issue a warning if an attempt is made to rank trackers based on less than 15 repetitions and issue an error if the number of repetitions is equal or lower to 5.

- **Can a tracker use a pre-trained model?**

    The current aim of the VOT Challenges is single-object short-term trackers that do not apply pre-learned models of object appearance (model-free), however, this does not strictly mean that the tracker must not use any pre-trained data, it means that no object-specific information based on specific dataset sequence can be used (like recognizing the sequence based on stored image features or even file path). More precisely, one has to be careful about two guidelines:

     - The tracker must not know what kind of object is it tracking, there should be no sequence specific pre-trained model, only one model is allowed for the entire dataset.
     - If a model is trained in advance, it should not be trained on the sequences in the testing dataset. This is similar to machine learning evaluation, where the training and learning datasets are separated, but since we do not provide a separate training set, you have to accumulate your own (that does not include any VOT sequences). It is, however, fair to mention which sequences were used and the size of the final model once the results are published as we rely on fair-play and any problem to reproduce results will cast some doubt on the validity of the comparison.

- **How to perform evaluation only on baseline experiment?**

  Alter a variable `{{experiments}}` in experiment stack you are using, e.g. for VOT2013 stack, edit file `vot-toolkit/stacks/stack_vot2013.m` by changing `experiments = {baseline, region_noise, grayscale};` to `experiments = {baseline};`

- **The evaluation crashes, what do I do?**

  To debug crashes, turn on debug information in `vot-workspace/configuration.m` by uncommenting line `set_global_variable('debug', 1);`. After that evaluation kit is more verbose and it is easier to debug your tracker. If this happens at the beginning of the evaluation it is very likely that you have not integrated your tracker correctly. Make sure that you first test the integration using `run_test` script.

- **Long-term evaluation**

  It is required that long-term trackers report confidence of their prediction besides predicted bounding box. The toolkit does not specify the range of the confidence score. Interpretation of the score is the following: high value represents high confidence, while low value represents low confidence of the predicted position. For more details of integrating long-term trackers please see [tutorial page](/howto/integration.html) and examples in the toolkit directory `tracker/examples`.

### Analysis

- **The results in ranking analysis change if I add another tracker, is this correct?**

  Yes, this can happen in case of overall ranks that are obtained with averaging over multiple partial ranks. See next question for a more detailed explanation.

- **When I compare trackers A and B with the ranking methodology, I get the result that A is better than B. After I add the tracker C, the tracker A may perform worse than B, is this correct?**

  You are probably observing the overall ranking that is obtained by averaging per-attribute or per-sequence partial ranks. If a new tracker C is added, it may perform same as one of the other trackers, e.g. A (the difference is not statistically or practically different). In this case both trackers are assigned their average rank, which means that the tracker A essentially gets a lower rank than before. This can lead to overall rank getting lower. It is therefore important to always also look at partial ranks and raw scores when interpreting the results.

- **When I compare trackers A and B, the robustness and accuracy rankings of A are both better than the robustness and accuracy rankings of B. Nevertheless, in terms of the expected overlap metric, the tracker B is better than A. What is the reason for this?**

   The ranking methodology applied to many trackers should be thought of as a competition among trackers in which the rule is that if a tracker's performance is negligibly different from another tracker, they will get the same rank. If you are applying the methodology that performs ranking on each sequence and averages the results, then the sequences are competitions. This means that if we have a set of 20 trackers, and tracker A in some cases (e.g., in some sequences) cannot be discerned from a tracker that is positioned higher in terms of average measure, the rank of tracker A will be pulled up -- this might increase the difference between A and B. Note that if tracker A is outperforming B on sequence 1 by 0.5 or 0.1 in raw measure, the rank difference will always be "1" if these are statistically/practically significant. Because of such type of normalization, you could see a tracker A being ranked higher than B just because it was better on more sequences.

   When averaging the per-sequence raw values, the amount by which one tracker outperforms another on each sequence matters. For example, let's say tracker A is better than B in nine out of ten sequences by small, but non-negligible margin. On the tenth sequence, the tracker B significantly outperforms A. It may happen that the average performance of B will be higher. That is the peril of averaging raw results.

   Our advice would be to report the expected average overlap as the main measure, and also separately report the raw values of the accuracy and robustness. This will give you significant insight into tracker performance and you can discuss why one tracker is better than the other and in which aspects. One tracker may be better in robustness, and that may be very important for some applications, other applications can cope with less robust, but more accurate trackers. Once you determine that your tracker A is better than the second-best tracker B, you can test whether this difference is statistically and practically different. You can do this by applying the ranking only to these two trackers (without inclusion of all other!). If A is consistently ranked higher than B, then it means that A was better than B in terms of statistical as well as practical differences, which is a strong evidence of improved performance.

   In any case, while it is certainly appealing to report a single measure, we advise against it since each measure show only a certain aspect of the performance. It is scientifically more insightful and useful for the scientific community to report a few interpretable measures and discuss their values.
