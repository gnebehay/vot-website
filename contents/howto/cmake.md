# Building tracker examples using CMake

[CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) is a cross-platform, open-source build system. It is a family of tools designed to build, test and package software. CMake generates native makefiles and IDE projects that can be used with the compiler environment of your choice. To compile the example trackers with CMake you can place the following script to the `vot-toolkit/tracker/examples/native` directory to the file `CMakeLists.txt`. Then use CMake to generate a project or makefile for your compiler and compile the examples.

<h4>TraX protocol</h4>

This example explains how to prepare a CMake project using the VOT C/C++ wrapper. It is however recommended that you integrate support for TraX protocol directly as the tracker will also work with the toolkit but also with other TraX clients. Follow the [official TraX tutorials](https://trax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html) for more information.
